      <p class="hero-body title">Details about my first semester</p>
      <p>My first semester was a whirlwind of new experiences, challenges, 
        and personal growth. Stepping into a new environment filled me with 
        a mix of excitement and nervousness, but it didn’t take long to find my rhythm. 
        From adjusting to a different style of learning to managing my own schedule, 
        every week brought something new to learn—both in and out of the classroom.

        Academically, I was introduced to subjects that were both intellectually 
        stimulating and, at times, overwhelming. Some courses pushed me out of my comfort zone, 
        but they also taught me discipline, time management, and the importance of asking for 
        help when needed. Beyond the academics, I met people from diverse backgrounds, 
        many of whom I now consider good friends. We shared late-night study sessions, 
        cafeteria meals, and the occasional moment of mutual panic before exams.
        
        Looking back, my first semester wasn’t perfect—but it was exactly what I needed to begin this new chapter. It laid the foundation for not only what I want to learn, but who I want to become.
        
        
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="hero-body subtitle" style="color: #007d64;"><b>Classes</b></p>
      <p>My first semester introduced me to a wide range of subjects that not only expanded my 
        academic knowledge but also helped me discover what truly interests me. 
        Each class came with its own set of challenges—some required analytical thinking, 
        others creative expression—but all played a part in shaping my learning experience.

        These classes weren’t just names on a schedule; they were spaces where I learned to 
        engage with new ideas, collaborate with peers, and develop better study habits. 
        Some topics sparked a genuine curiosity, while others pushed me to work harder than 
        I ever had before. Together, they laid the groundwork for my future academic path.
        
        Classes I attended included: <em><ul>
          <li>Introduction to Object Oriented Programming - Java</li>
          <li>Linear Algebra</li>
          <li>Introduction to study</li>
          <li>Physics for engineers - </li>
        </ul></em>
        <br>
      <p class="hero-body subtitle" style="color: #007d64;"><b>Communities</b></p>
      <p>One of the most fulfilling parts of my first semester was finding a sense of 
        belonging through the communities I joined. The African community on campus quickly 
        became a space where I felt understood, supported, and empowered. Beyond the cultural 
        events and shared experiences, what stood out most was how willing everyone was to help 
        each other grow—especially when it came to navigating things like academics, networking, 
        and even the job search. Through conversations, referrals, and shared opportunities, 
        I found valuable guidance that helped me take real steps toward my career goals.

        I also got involved in a few project-based communities, where collaboration and creativity
         were central. Working with others on real-world challenges helped me apply what I was 
         learning in the classroom and develop practical skills in problem-solving and teamwork. 
         These experiences gave me a glimpse into the professional world and taught me how much 
         can be achieved when people come together with a shared purpose. Together, these communities shaped not just my semester, 
        but my sense of purpose and direction moving forward.</p>
